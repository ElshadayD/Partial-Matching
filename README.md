## Image Partial Matching Web App
This is a simple Streamlit web application for performing partial image matching using OpenCV. The application allows users to upload two images and checks if the first image is a subset of the second image.

## Features
Upload Images: Users can upload two images (Image 1 and Image 2) using file upload widgets.
Partial Matching: The application uses template matching to determine if Image 1 is a subset of Image 2.
Result Display: Displays the uploaded images side by side and provides a success or error message based on the matching result.
